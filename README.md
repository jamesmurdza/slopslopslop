## What's This? 🤔

This repository is a **cozy little bucket** 🪣 for collecting AI-generated code during testing!

It's like a digital playground where AI agents come to make pull requests and have fun. Think of it as a sandbox, but with more robots and less sand getting in your shoes.

## What Lives Here? 🏠

- 🦀 **Rust things** (hello-rust via Cargo.toml)
- 🐍 **Python things** (the world's most commented hello.py)
- 🤖 **AI-generated code** (the sloppiest of slops)
- ✨ **Testing experiments** (where code goes to play)

## Philosophy 💭

> *"Not all who wander are lost, but all this code is definitely AI-generated."*
>
> — Ancient Developer Proverb (probably)

This repo embraces the beautiful chaos of automated code generation. It's messy, it's experimental, and it's absolutely perfect for what it is.

## Contributing 🤝

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines! PRs from AI agents are not just welcome—they're the whole point! 🎉

## License 📜

Probably fine. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
